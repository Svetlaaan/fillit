# Fillit 100/100

This project is written in C.  
Backtracking algorithm.

**The goal of project:**  
Given a set of Tetrominoes, find a way to assemble them in the smallest possible square.

## Project Description  
A Tetrimino block is a shape made up of 4 consecutive characters.  
For the purpose of this projecte, Tetrominoes are considered fixed, meaning that they cannot be rotated and there are a total of 19 possible pieces that can be provided as input.  

*A few examples of valid descriptions of Tetriminos:*

*A few examples of invalid descriptions of Tetriminos:*

Program must display the smallest assembled square on the standard output. To identify each Tetrimino in the square solution, we will assign a capital letter to each
Tetrimino, starting with ’A’ and increasing for each new Tetrimino.
